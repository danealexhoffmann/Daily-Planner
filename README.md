# Daily-Planner.

## To start
- (In a terminal window) Install dependencies with **npm install**
- (In a terminal window) Run **npm start** to start server.

## Viewing the site locally

Once you have installed all dependencies with **npm install** and started the server with **npm start**, a browser window should automatically pop-up navigating to (http://localhost:3000), where you will be able to see the full application locally. 

## About the app

My goal was to create a minimalistic to-do application, using React and Redux, which allows you to keep track of the tasks that you have planned for the day. The app greeting will change dynamically depending on the time of day and there is a subheading which will always have the current date if you ever need a reminder. You can easily create and delete tasks as is necessary. As you complete and check off tasks the app will dynamically keep track of how many tasks out of the total you have completed. 

## What I learnt building this project.

I built this app while learning how to use Redux inside of a React project to efficiently handle state within the application. Once wrapping my head around how Redux allows for state-management globally, I worked on getting used to the syntax and implementation of the feature inside of my app. I can see why Redux is such an integral part of React development as it allows you to easilly pass necessary data across app components without much hinderence compared to the native state-management inside of React.
